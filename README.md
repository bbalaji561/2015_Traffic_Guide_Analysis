# 2015_Traffic_Guide_Analysis
A modern system to guide the users and bus passengers with bus schedules with an additional information of time required to reach the users location. Data analyzing is used to analyze the data which is stored from the previous recordings. An efficient algorithm is used to analyze the data and to provide the users the best solution which involves machine learning. The system is best used by all types of road users to get the current status of traffic in their desired routes. The efficiency of the system is high compared to the current system.
Best alternate paths are provided to the users in the case of heavy traffic in the routes as per the algorithm. Additional bus in the route can also be requested when the algorithm detects that the station is overcrowded. Results of this system is efficient if data analyzed is more. The results showed that this system is efficient and better than the current system.
The more data we get, the more analysis we do and more efficient the data would be.
